### Description

BLASTER is a pure VB 2D space shooter originally by HLMODER ( http://www.planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=72921&lngWId=1 ) I was so impressed by how fast and smooth it ran I decided to take up the project to see what I could with it.

I have made changes to virtually all the code, added many new features and changed some of the graphics. There are several thing I still want to add such as more levels and bosses but the big one is to add sound.
